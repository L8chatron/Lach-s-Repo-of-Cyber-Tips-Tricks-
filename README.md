Hi, my names LD, this is my repo where I will be sharing a bunch of tutorials,
related to the field of cybersecurity, and as a way for me to learn,
I will be teaching you in the most effective yet efficent way possible.

Check out my new tutorial on setting up Whonix, within VirtualBox, relevent to a WINDOWS 11 OS.
Whonix is a bunch of fun to use, and I recommended you download it and have a snoop around on what the tor network has to offer :).
